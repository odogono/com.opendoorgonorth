import { e } from '@site';
import Heading from '../../components/heading';

<Heading e={e} />

But to the point, let’s dive into how ES6 modules are different.

## Defining bindings and scopes

__What’s a binding?__

```javascript
var a = 1;
```

Has three parts:

1. a, an Identifier. Identifiers are names that can be assigned to values in JavaScript.
2. 2, avalue` - in this case, a NumericLiteral.
3. var a = 2, a binding of the value 2 to the name a, with the var type, which means that a can be reassigned and has function scope. It could also be a let or const binding. The binding is what allows us to refer to the value 2, or whatever the value of a is, by writing a, instead of writing the literal value.


the `dst` is not set

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'charterbold_italic';
    src: url('charter_bold_italic-webfont.eot') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('charter_bold_italic-webfont.woff') format('woff');
    font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;
}
```

```filth
$es [
  /component/channel_member#/channel !ca $channel_ids ==
  /component/channel_member !bf
  @c
] select

// select client attr, and make sure there are no duplicates
/client pluck unique 
                
// make sure this list of clients doesnt include the client_id
[ $client_id != ] filter
```
