Ecset is my own implementation of the 
[Entity Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq#what-is-ecs) 
design pattern.

It was originally extracted from a game I was developing at the time, and evolved into a 
standalone library which I have continued to work and experiment with over several years.

The primary implementation has been javascript, or more recently Typescript. An Elixir 
implementation is lagging behind.

Ecset has been used in production on some of my past projects, and is currently employed 
heavily in my Static Site Generator Grosmont.

Like most ECS implementations, it works on basic principles:

- Entities are nothing more that IDs, or in this case, 53bit integers
- Components are schema defined datatypes containing properties
- Entities contain zero or more components
- Entities can add or remove components dynamically
- It has processors (Systems) which are functions that work on sets of entities with a 
specified component signature.

With Ecset, I have focussed on the concept of an Entity Set. This is a data structure of 
Entities that can be queried and is typically backed by a persistent data store.

Example Entity Set implementations include ones backed by Sqlite, IndexedDb, LevelDb, 
Redis, and just plain old in-memory. The data structures lend themselves particularly well 
to relational databases, so the Sqlite variant has been used the most.


An important aspect of ECS is the ability to match entities with Processors. As an example, 
a processor which updates entities in a coordinate space would be interested in Position 
and Velocity components only. 

Initially, I began with using bitfields to match entities, wrapped around a simple DSL:

```
Q.all('/component/channel_member')
```

Over time, this expanded to include selection based on component properties

```
Q.all('/component/channel_member').where(Q.attr('client').equals(clientID))
```


Until eventually, as these things tend to do, it evolved into a language based on Forth 
that I named Filth:

```
$es [
  /component/channel_member#/channel !ca $channel_ids ==
  /component/channel_member !bf
  @c
] select

// select client attr, and make sure there are no duplicates
/client pluck unique 
                
// make sure this list of clients doesnt include the client_id
[ $client_id != ] filter
```

This allows a lot of flexibility in creating queries that can capture the components 
needed for processing. In some ways this makes Ecset comparable to GraphQL. A goal was 
to allow clients, say a browser, to fetch data from a server in a concise language independent manner.

ECS has typically been employed in domains such as games, where factors such as cache 
locality and low level optimisation are important. My aim with this project has been to 
explore how such a pattern can be employed in other scenarios.






At certain times, development on EcSet has been very ‘bottom up’. Adding features can 
be very compulsive without a clear requirement. I have probably removed more code than 
now exists. What is saving this project is working on projects which utilise it. My rule 
of thumb with an API is that there should be at least 3 working implementations, preferably 
different enough to stress it in the required ways.
