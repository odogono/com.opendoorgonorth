Static site generators are currently the in-thing amongst the hackerati. The principle 
is being that you generate plain, largely javascript-free, web pages using some kind of 
build process ready to be placed directly on a web server.
Aside from wanting to be trendy, and badly needing a site where I could bare my soul to 
the world, I wanted to further stress and develop my library EcSet. So discarding the 
quick and easy option of using one of the many fine pre-existing generators, I began 
work on my own.

To summarise what EcSet actually does; it is an Entity Component framework - it provides 
a way of structuring, storing, and operating on data. Entities are collections of Components. 
Components are where the data lives. Processors perform operations on Entities and their 
Components.

In practice, this has resulted in a very modular, clean solution, that forced me to think 
clearly about how the data is structured. The processors are largely atomic in their operation - they work on defined sets of entities, which means they can be added, removed, and changed without breaking the system as a whole. The order in which they called is still important however, so there is still some dependency. This is something I am particularly pleased with, and has justified the upfront design.

In terms of what it can build, the main input type is MDX. This format can largely be 
thought of as Markdown, but with the ability to use JSX. Its a good trade mix of minimal 
text only markup which lets you focus on the content, with the extra power of being able 
to include React components as needed.
The SSG can of course also cope with plain JSX, which is either imported as a component 
into other MDX or JSX, or as a standalone file to be rendered into a page.

Stylesheet files with the `.sass` extension are compiled into css. From there, they can 
either be written to a destination, or imported and then written out as part of MDX/JSX 
files.

Other formats, such as images or html, are treated as static files, and they are written 
as is to the destination.

The system supports incremental builds based on file timestamps. It also uses dependencies 
to determine which files need to be processed. For example, changing a stylesheet causes 
all the files that import that file to also be included in the build.

The generator is invoked from the command line, taking a configuration file as an argument. 
It can also be run as a server, which is useful during development and also adds some debug 
information.
