My name is Alex Veenendaal.

I've been a problem solver and developer of software since Internet Explorer 3.0, 
Photoshop 4.0, and Super Mario 64 was the latest hotness. Read details of some of my projects
of note <a href="/projects">here</a>. I currently reside in Devon, UK.

I'm interested in lots of (pseudo)random shiny things, which i tend to link firehose to friends
whether they like it or not. So in a bid to avoid another humiliating blocking, I 
decided to redirect that energy into building my own little garden.

This website is built using <a href="/projects/ssg">Grosmont</a>, a static site generator I wrote myself. 
Clearly I could have saved some time using one of the many fine existing tools,
but I saw this as an opportunity to learn, and also to further prove and flex another 
<a href="/projects/ecset">project</a> i've been tinkering with.

Obviously, it was also a great displacement for actually doing the writing.

_Open Door Go North?_ Many years ago I took part in a videogame pub quiz with that as the
team name. Despite being the only member I managed to place 2nd. which I am still sore
about.
