I am a software developer with over 20 years experience in the often intertwined areas of 
mobile, games, and web. 
I hesitate to use the phrase _Full Stack_, but quite often that is how I find myself working.

I started out producing high profile websites during Web 1.0, trying to sneak VRML in whenever I could.

From there I transitioned into games, building a text parser on a MUD, a MMO Football title, and then
into mobile games..

I started working on mobile games and apps when WAP was a thing and 64Kb was the maximum 
executable size, from feature phone to smart fondle slab.

I am a strong believer in URLs. I am still trying to prove whether Entity Component Systems 
are a useful approach.

My current primary technologies are React and Typescript. 

I've passed through language phases of Java, C/C++/C#, Lingo, Lua, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
Nothing makes me happier than Elixir.

I've stored and queried in CouchDb, Leveldb, MongoDb, Redis, Sql Server, and especially Sqlite.


The following represents some of the project highlights i have worked on over the years.
