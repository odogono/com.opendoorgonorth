I am a software developer with over 20 years experience in the often intertwined areas of 
mobile, games, and web.

For the last 10 or so years, I have been contracting. Typically I am employed to work on a self
contained area. Most frequently creating an App. Often this is something that has to work with an existing
system. I hesitate to use the phrase _Full Stack_, but quite often that is how I find myself working.

My current primary technologies I like to use are React and Typescript. I've passed through language phases 
of Java, C/C++/C#, Lingo, Lua, Objective-C, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
Nothing makes me happier than Elixir.

I've stored and queried in CouchDb, Leveldb, MongoDb, Redis, Sql Server, and especially Sqlite.

The following represents some of the more interesting projects i have worked on over the years:
