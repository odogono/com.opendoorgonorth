1st March - 7th March

The majority of the coding this week has been spent on Grosmont’s JS rendering. In particular the issue of a JSX resource being able to access the EntitySet and render it. Since useEffect is a no-op on the server, I had to implement a custom hook, as well as employ [Stateful Hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stateful-hooks).

The other battle was with special case rendering of an entity. Rendering a page with the most recent blog post included is the primary use case. In that case the posts layout, which is incorporated by default, is un-needed. It’s a little like rendering a reflection in a 3d engine - as well as the normal render of the scene, you do a second render with a different camera. A fair amount of time was taken by trying to find an elegant API for this. For the sake of getting something working however, I’ve had to hardcode certain rendering tasks in place, which doesn’t feel great. But, it’s working, and my technical bank balance is not too far in the red.

Two notable packets of media this week. [Louis Theroux Live at the Royal Festival Hall](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/7-bfk9m-4l8kp-blcga-jwabs-blbb8-b9mjx-fj3gr-j4lyp-9jlhe-a4bhm-c67yy-szhgm-m8pcd-l376z-zjb32-wh9dr-za87b-c8l3j-byyhb-segba-hlsc6-5m648-aef2d-2n3wg-tpcha-fsb4a-stlxm-7hb5z) was reliably great and raised my somewhat low spirits considerably.

I’d seen mention of [For All Mankind](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7) previously, but I couldn’t muster any enthusiasm for it. This weeks [SpaceX launch](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56274183) was terrific - barely indistinguishable from CGI. But it triggered long past memories of keeping space shuttle scrapbooks, so I was all in for more spacing, and the show did not disappoint in that regard. Although; So. Much. Smoking. I felt wheezy and exhilarated by then end of the first series.

[I’m a short afternoon walk and you’re putting way too much pressure on me](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/im-a-short-afternoon-walk-and-youre-putting-way-too-much-pressure-on-me). I broke rules a little this weekend and went to the coast so I could breath in the sea. No regrets. It made all the difference.


Song of the week

A major milestone I think - the first time my daughters have introduced me to something which I don’t totally hate. K-pop no less. It’s nothing that original or surprising, but it’s a real ear-worm, and I believe its on Beat Saber.
