9th - 16th May

My weeknotes streak has not been great! I think I have to go to blog purgatory or something to atone.

This week has been the final push on getting odgn.com up and running. The focus primarily being on the content - the important stuff - rather than tinkering with the engine. 
Sigh I am still at the point of being embarrassed of what I have written. Still, as the saying goes, Perfect is the enemy of the good enough.

Related to that, I picked up the book Chaos monkey this week. I admit I was curious after the [controversy over the books author](https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/5/13/22435266/apple-employees-petition-controversial-antonio-garcia-martinez-new-hire-departure). The majority of the passages occur early on and, yeah. Not great. 
The book itself is insightful, and a great read. But it does occasionally drop down into a kind of Alpha punching down. Nothing would be lost by not including it. You can take the man out of Goldman Sachs, but you can’t take … etc. 

It was a welcome distraction from the [book I’m still slogging through](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/unconquerable-sun/9781800243200). I’ve found book reading tough of late generally anyway, this one suffers from introducing too many characters and names. Still enjoying it however.

First (local) asparagus of the year. Ah, the [fragrant aroma](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine) in the morning.

Podcast highlight of the week was [How to be Sad interviewing Dr Xand](https://howtobesadwithhelenrussell.podbean.com/e/season-2-4-xand-van-tulleken/). Just kidding., it was [buckles](https://www.adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts/wmcgmfe7zj7chps-89fa4) yet again.

After months of half watching, I finally finished series 3 of American Gods. Other than knowing I liked it a lot, I can’t really remember details of the book, so the reveals were kind of new. There’s not a lot of good stuff to watch atm, or more likely I am just not feeling it.

Similar story with music. The Spotify release radar and the couple of playlists I follow have yielded nothing to turn my head for a few weeks now.
I’m in danger of killing this track dead by playing it too much, but [this performance at the BRIT awards](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iKm5-XtXcII) had a pretty great, and topical, virtual environment. Want that jacket.

Having said that, it was great last year, and a Richard X remix is always notable, so Annie it is!
