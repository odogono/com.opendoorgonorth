My primary school was tiny. Really small. And sat in one corner was a BBC model B computer which I adored.

BBC Domesday arrived one day, and the whole school set about collecting details from the village.

[The BBC Domesday System](http://domesday.computinghistory.org.uk/community_south.html) is still online.
