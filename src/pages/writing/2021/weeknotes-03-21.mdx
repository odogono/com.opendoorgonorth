The impressive aspect is the continuous output - 5000 items. Perhaps less impressive is that his growth as an artist is a
little stunted. Its refinements of a single idea over and over. As if Radiohead had continued on making OK Computer endlessly as some 
would want rather than grow exploring different approaches.
A future function of AI to ‘fork’ an artist at a particular stage and continue producing variations and small refinements on the same.

Can't help but be impressed by his work ethic. Punching in every day no matter what.

In some ways this is what I’ve done with Ecset. Its something I’ve worked on for 8+ years. Mostly its been an intellectual exercise, 
and a general practice space for techniques and ideas. It was deployed into production once in the past, and now again I have had the time 
to push it into 
tangible product. What could easily have happened is that I lost interest along the way like many many other side-projects. In many ways 
its still a mess, but I have some pride in the journey over those years. That I stuck with it. I still feel as if it could still 
be proved to be a dead-end. But perhaps only if I drop it.
