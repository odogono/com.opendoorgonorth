Full steam ahead on SSG. 

Splitting out common utils into its own package.

The bad forth language split out into its own language - Filth. The temptation to work on this alone is nearly overwhelming, but SSG must come first.

Filth - adding native (eg node) functions as words

Hasn’t stopped me considering ideas for it though. Instead of just the typical web console, a version of [p5](https://p5js.org) might be interesting, then at least something visual can be shown.


Theres a certain feeling that occurs when something you have been working on for a while suddenly just works. Without problems.

I care a lot - lots of delicious fun playing with your sympathies - although you came out rooting for the old lady - but (sigh) cop out of an ending. Although the final track was great [DJ Shadow]. Enjoyed Peter Dinklage suspended in frustration on hoops. Need to try that technique instead of just releasing the hounds.
