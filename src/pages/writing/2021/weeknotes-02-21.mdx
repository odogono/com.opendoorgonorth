Full steam ahead on the SSG.

Took some time to split out common functions and utils into its own package. I prefer my packages
to not have loads of external dependencies, but these are used by a couple of my projects so makes sense.

My DSL which has feature crept into a full blown language has acquired a name - Filth. I'm quite
pleased with this name, as well as being close to Forth, it reflects its nature well.
The temptation to work on this alone is nearly overwhelming, but must focus on the SSG.

Theres a certain feeling that occurs when something you have been working on for a while suddenly 
just works. Without problems. There must be a german word for that.

[I care a lot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9893250/) - lots of delicious fun playing with your sympathies.
Unusual in that none of the characters you particularly rooted for. The (victim) mother probably more so than the
others. 
The (sigh) ending was a bit of cop out. Although the final track was great [DJ Shadow]. Enjoyed Peter 
Dinklage suspended in frustration. Need to try that technique instead of just releasing the hounds.
