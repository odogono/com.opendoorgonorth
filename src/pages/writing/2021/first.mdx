New Year, New Pretensions. 

Look! I’m a blogger now. Does that term even exist anymore?

After the best part of two decades I am finally, if not completely, disregarding my inhibitions and putting key to pixel.

Dogfooding my static cms - already dreadfully passe

A mixture of articles about my trade and whatever else floats into my head which I warn you is _a lot_, frequently _random_ and will _probably be largely incoherent_.

The freedom of writing when you know no-one is looking. Let’s hope that lasts until I can figure out how to craft a sentence which doesn’t inspire death.

I’ve always had to write to an extent; my much loved occupation for a couple of decades has been to write instructions for computers to carry out. But that has rules and tight expectations that this ambiguous, poorly defined  language does not. 
And sure, I’ve had to squeeze out helpful sometimes accurate documentation about said code, but there was hardly room for _personality_ or flowery prose there. Maybe that’s where I’ve been going wrong.

What I’m trying to excuse is that this is going to probably read as incredibly stilted and dry until I loosen my jangly flesh sausages. After all, you are not a computer, right? And you deserve an amount of amusement.

To date this almost immediately, I will reference the incoming AI GPT writing armageddon which will render most writings as redundant and _suspect_. Marketing waffle won’t cut it any more. The race is on to prove one is human. To be honest, I’m not completely convinced myself. So that’s another stated aim. This is basically an incredibly time consuming capture device pointed at myself to prove I’m not a robot. Well at least it’s more fun than picking out ‘crosswalks’.

Just be thankful this is not a podcast. _Yet_.
