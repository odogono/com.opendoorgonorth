Entering the 4th week of home-schooling B and P. No denying it feels a lot harder this time around.
The school has near-perfected the on-line resources, but attention spans are short all round.

The announcement that school's were reopening a near openly sobbing relief. 
Although it did take a lot more wind out of the home-schooling sails.

Daft punk splitting up. They are largely a miss for me. Exceptions being musique, Tron soundtrack, Weeknd. 
And Get Lucky I guess.

Reading [HHGTTG](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1230137M/The_illustrated_hitchhiker%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy) with B + P. 
The pictures helped considerably. While a lot of it clearly went over their heads, there was enough to hold their attention. 
They didn’t know who genghis kahn was!

The search for more local multiplayer fuel led me 
to [Puzzle Bobble 4 friends](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/bubble-bobble-4-friends-the-baron-is-back-switch/).
We completed in about two or three sessions. Lot's of shouting. So a success by any messure.

Continuing our Buffy watch. Giles had an English off with another Watcher, which was excruciating. How can they drink tea that late at night. 
Still can’t believe this was mid 90s.

Read [Cherry](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/cherry-9781784708832/9781784708832) over about 24hrs, which finished a very dry spell of 
not finishing books. 
Grim, but narrated in an almost Forest Gump style monotone. Occasionally I would finish the end of a chapter and on to the next, 
before double taking and then re-reading the often devastating last lines.

Lack of Genghis kahn awareness led to the [Oversimplified](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=26EivpCPHnQ) series on YouTube, which follows 
the same format as the excellent [History of Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5LY4Mz15o). Talk really fast, occasionally drop 
in some memes, while reeling off facts just fast enough to not be boring. It felt like it had some 
educational value anyway, although it made P worried about taxes.

I think these hyper fast, information dense videos have value.
Like blipverts. Abridged. There are lots of things this could be applied to. ‘I know kung fu’ moment. Keeps the attention. Some of the 
oversimplified earlier efforts definitely sagged into dryness. Every n seconds there has to be a meme, or funny, or swear. 
You get a sense of the whole thing, and then can rewind stop for details.

If [Midi Sans Frontieres](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=X_k2lih0T6U) was my song of the first lockdown, then this is surely the theme of this one
