4th week of homeschooling


Daft punk - largely a miss for me. Exceptions being musique, Tron soundtrack, Weeknd. And Get Lucky I guess.

Reading HHGTTG with the girls (illustrated version). So the pictures helped a lot. Just about holds their attention. They didn’t know who genghis kahn was!

The search for more local multiplayer fuel led me to get Puzzle Bobble 4 friends.

Buffy. Giles had an English off with another Watcher, which was excruciating. How can they drink tea that late at night. Still can’t believe this was mid 90s.

Announcement that schools reopening a relief. Although it has somewhat taken the wind out of my home schooling sails.

Read Cherry over about 24hrs, which finished a very dry spell of not finishing books. Grim, but narrated in an almost Forest Gump style monotone. Occasionally I would finish the end of a chapter and on to the next, before double taking and then re-reading the often devastating last lines.



Genghis kahn led to the oversimplified series on YouTube, which follows the same format as the excellent history of japan videos - talk really fast, occasionally drop in some memes, while reeling off facts just fast enough to not be boring. It felt like it had some educational value anyway, although it made P worried about taxes. I think these hyper fast, information dense videos have value. Like blipverts. Abridged. There are lots of things this could be applied to. ‘I know kung fu’ moment. Keeps the attention. Some of the oversimplified earlier efforts definitely sagged into dryness. Every n seconds there has to be a meme, or funny, or swear. You get a sense of the whole thing, and then can rewind stop for details


Song of the week

If Médecins Sans frontière was my song of the first lockdown, then this is surely the theme of this one

And I've been solo
Texture like real low
Feels like I am a stone
Never cried
