Ecset is my own implementation of the 
[Entity Component System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq#what-is-ecs) 
design pattern.

It was originally extracted from a game I was developing at the time, and evolved into a 
standalone library which I have continued to work and experiment with over several years.

The primary implementation has been javascript, or more recently Typescript. An Elixir 
implementation is part way in development.

Ecset has been used in production on some of my past projects, and is currently employed 
heavily in my Static Site Generator [Grosmont]('./ssg').

Like most ECS implementations, it works on basic principles:

- Entities are nothing more that IDs, or in this case, 53bit integers
- Components are schema defined datatypes containing properties
- Entities contain zero or more components
- Entities can add or remove components dynamically
- It has processors (Systems) which are functions that work on sets of entities with a 
specified component signature.

With Ecset, I have focussed on the concept of an Entity Set. This is a data structure of 
Entities that can be queried and is typically backed by a persistent data store.

Example Entity Set implementations include ones backed by Sqlite, IndexedDb, LevelDb, 
Redis, and just plain old in-memory. The data structures lend themselves particularly well 
to relational databases, so the Sqlite variant has been used the most.


An important aspect of ECS is the ability to match entities with Processors. As an example, 
a processor which updates entities in a coordinate space would be interested in Position 
and Velocity components only.

To meet this requirement, I developed a language named Filth, largely based on 
[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). As well as being able
to match Entities, it has simple capabilities to manipulate data.
Because of the way the language works, it is very easy to limit operations to be read-only.
This makes it suitable to be used from a client in much the same way GraphQL is.

Historically, the ECS pattern has typically been employed in domains such as games, where factors 
such as cache locality and low level optimisation are important. My aim with this project has been to 
explore how such a pattern can be employed in other scenarios.
