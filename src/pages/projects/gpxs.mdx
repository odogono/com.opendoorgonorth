GPXS was an arcade racing game developed for mobile phones. It offered two modes of play - 
championship, in which you would race AI to finish first over 7 tracks, and a time trial 
mode to beat current best times.

It was a re-skinning of an engine that I wrote that had previously been published in the 
form of Revs Racing and Red Bull Track Attack.

It was coded in a low-overhead variant of Java called J2ME. Often the maximum size of the 
distribution could not exceed 64Kb, which meant that lots of tricks were employed to make 
the code, artwork, and sound effects would fit.

It was built for 32 types of mobile device, and supported the six EFIGS languages. This was 
fairly typical at the time, and was often tricky to manage. Around this time I wrote a 
PHP/MySQL web application to automate the uploading of builds within the company.
