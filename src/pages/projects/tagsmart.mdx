The Tagsmart app was designed to be a used as a guide and browser for galleries. It 
utilised iBeacons, gps, and qr codes in order to respond and display relevant content. 
A user would approach an artwork, and the app would display more information in response.

I developed the iOS app in Objective-C, and worked with iBeacon hardware to find a 
workable sensing solution.
