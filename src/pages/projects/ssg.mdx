Grosmont is a Static Site Generator. It was created with the goals of building this site
and to further explore Entity Component Systems using my library EcSet.

The main content source type is MDX. This format can largely be 
thought of as Markdown, but with the ability to use JSX. Its a good trade mix of minimal 
text only markup which lets you focus on the content, with the extra power of being able 
to include React components as needed.

The SSG can of course also cope with plain JSX, which is either imported as a component 
into other MDX or JSX, or as a standalone file to be rendered into a page.

Stylesheets can be provided as plain `.css` files, or compiled SASS. From there, they can 
either be written to a destination, or imported by pages and inlined.

Other formats, such as images or HTML, are treated as static files and are written 
as is to the destination.

The system supports incremental builds based on file timestamps. It also uses dependencies 
to determine which files need to be processed. For example, changing a stylesheet causes 
all the files that import that file to also be included in the build.

The generator is invoked from the command line, taking a configuration file as an argument. 
It can also be run as a server, which is useful during development and also adds some debug 
information.

## Data structures

Grosmont employs my Entity Component System [EcSet](./ecset) for its data. Each page produced
is an Entity, made up of a collection of Components each of which hold data about a particular
aspect.

<div className="app-screens">
    <AppImage className="app-screen" src="/media/ssg" alt="Entity Map" />
</div>


A pipeline of processors takes the Entities and applies transformations to them. Certain
processors transform from one form to another (for example MDX to JS), extract information
(tags or dates), or write to the filesystem.

## What I learned

This project is my most recent application of my [EcSet](./ecset) library. Most of the time
spent has been on expanding and proving the libraries capabilities. 

The nature of Entities and Components forced me to think carefully about how the data
is best structured to serve the various requirements. 

Processors work on a specific
signature of Components, and so this means they are very modular and are very easy
to swap in since they have few code dependencies. The order in which they are called
is still important, but failure doesn't break the system as a whole.

While I have used React extensively on the client side, this has been the first server
React development I have done. Largely it has been straightforward. The use of asynchronous
hooks was one thing that was not built-in and I had to engineer a way of dealing with them.

Grosmont is something that I hope will continue to evolve with Opendoorgonorth. 
It hasn't been a goal to 'productise' it as such. If anything it is a case study for 
[EcSet](./ecset).
