## What / Who / Goals

An online text-based adventure game, or [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), based on the 
Agatha Christie book, whose target audience was primarily mid-american housewives. The aim of the 
game was to inhabit various exclusive clubs and tea rooms, occasionally *j’accuse*, develop social 
bonds, and generally carry on in a way befitting of a member of the 1930s social elite. In some 
ways, it was a text only [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us).

## My Role

I wrote the natural language parser, responsible for translating plain English into commands that 
would manipulate the games object database. 
For example, ’Take the smoking gun and place it underneath the bed’.
[Richard Bartle](https://mud.co.uk) acted as a consultant on the project, and he would occasionally 
attempt to sell me on the benefits of Prolog.

Later in the project, I worked with the designer on the system of procedurally generating murders.

## Tech Stack

Despite the complexity of the engine itself, the technology was very straightforward. 
It was Java as far as the eye could see, from the server, to the client (An Applet). 
Even the database was embedded Java. Simpler times.

## What I learnt

This was my first role in a project not directly involved with the web, so *a lot* is a good summary. 
My Java at this point was rudimentary, but regular code reviews steadily improved it. 
This was also my first encounter with Version Control, CVS, and the sometimes physical 
dangers (from my colleagues) of messing up a commit.
